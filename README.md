# Curious notebooks

A dump of all the notebooks I wrote to test Python libs and other curious analysis.

* [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) - Build beautiful web-based interfaces in Python
* [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Better demo on my [COTRECS folder](https://github.com/andfanilo/cotrecs_20181109).
* [Jupyter Kernel Gateway](https://jupyter-kernel-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Web server that provides headless access to Jupyter kernels
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Open source deep learning platform
* [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/index.html) - Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning focusing on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI) algorithms
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An open source machine learning framework for everyone
* [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html) - Python API for Spark
* Tutorials - A bunch of notebooks for fun analysis, and eventually future interviewing questions XD
